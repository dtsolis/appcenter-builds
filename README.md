# AppCenter Builds

This project works as a proxy for downloading builds produced on [appcenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms) without giving access to other areas (on appcenter) like Analytics, Diagnostics, Distribution etc.

## Use case

* You build apps for someone but you don't have access to Google Play Console or AppStore Connect.
* This *someone* is responsible for signing and publishing the apps and should not have full access on [appcenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms).
